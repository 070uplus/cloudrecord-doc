## About the review process

If you're using the doc as code approach, you should also consider using the same techniques for reviewing the doc as people use in reviewing code. This approach will involve using Prose.io as an interface. Users will have Github accounts and authorize Prose.io to access their Github.

There's an Edit me button on each page on this theme. This button allows collaborators to edit the content on Github.


## Add the edit button to your pages


## Instruct reviewers to authorize Prose.io

People who plan to review the project need to authorize Prose.io on their computers.
